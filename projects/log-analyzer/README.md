# Log File Analyzer (Cybersecurity Portfolio Project)

# Overview
This project analyzes server/system log files to detect suspicious activities such as:
- Brute-force login attempts
- Access to sensitive files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`)
- SQL injection attempts

It was built as part of my cybersecurity portfolio after completing the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**.

# Features
- Regex-based detection of suspicious log entries
- Extracts timestamps & IP addresses
- Generates CSV reports for easy review
- Includes sample logs for testing
